<h1># geekDOM</h1>
<h2>A stripped down clone of React</h2>

Created my own implementation of react with some additions to Rodrigo Pombo's version.

<ul>
<li>Functional components.</li>
<li> Array of children inside the jsx javascript.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to install :</h3>
<p>
  Run 

  ```npm i -S Abhicoding/geekDOM#master```
</p>
<h3> How to use :</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Add the following code 
  on top of each component file.
  
  ```// @jsx h```
  </li>
  <li>
  Import the follwing. (Component is not needed for functional component)
  
```import {render, h, Component} from 'geekdom'```
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage Pointers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Write the code as you would in React. The class for tags is written as it is.
  </li>
  <li>
    The value attribute for tags is written as it is.
  </li>
</ul>
